# Milestone 2
In this milestone we created five new types of diagrams, namely: Sequence Diagrams, Communication Diagrams, State Machine Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, and Timing Diagrams.<br>
We updated our previous diagrams from milestone 2 based on our iterative design process <br>
We also began development on a rapid prototype.
