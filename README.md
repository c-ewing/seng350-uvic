# Milestone 3 
In this milestone, we used 4 different design patterns to be included in our web application design, namely:  Decorator, Chain of Responsibility, Command and Facade. <br>
We created a class diagram for all object-oriented implementation modules for our web application. <br>
We also created an object-diagram to show the instances at the run-time.
